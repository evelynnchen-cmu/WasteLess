# WasteLess - 2024 Google Student Developer Club Solution Challenge

**About:**  
WasteLess is a mobile app that provides food-safety consumption analysis within seconds. Simple snap and upload a picture of your item and briefly describe its context to receive a suggestion on the degree to which the item is safe to consume. 

**Why WasteLess:**  
Our app is a convenient and innovative solution to consumer food waste. It is optimized for speed and convenience, uses trusted state-of-the-art technology, and is a solution for 3 of the United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals: 2 - Zero Hunger, 3 - Good Health and Well-being, and 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production.

**Impact Potential:**  
In the US alone, 31% of the food supply is wasted at consumer stages, which is around 200 lbs per individual. At a global scale, 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted, resulting in a market loss of $1 trillion every year. WasteLess aims to reduce these statistics via the power of cutting-edge AI technology.

**Note:**  
If you would like to run WasteLess locally, you must first replace the API keys in lib/main.dart with your own.
