Our Raspberry Pi component was developed in February 2024 at Stanford's Treehacks. Special thanks to the associated team members Michael Qi, Jhonathan Herrera, and Joyce Zhou.

**About:**  
WasteLess is a application that provides food-safety consumption analysis within seconds. In the mobile app, simply snap and upload a picture of your item and briefly describe its context to receive a suggestion on the degree to which the item is safe to consume. With a Raspberry Pi component, public-use WasteLess applications can be deployed to areas without smartphones, democratizing this technology for all.

**Why WasteLess:**  
Our app is a convenient and innovative solution to consumer food waste. It is optimized for speed and convenience, uses trusted state-of-the-art technology, and is a solution for 4 of the United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals: 2 - Zero Hunger, 3 - Good Health and Well-being, 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, and 13 - Climate Action.

**Impact Potential:**  
In the US alone, 31% of the food supply is wasted at consumer stages, which is around 200 lbs per individual. At a global scale, 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted, resulting in a market loss of $1 trillion every year. WasteLess aims to reduce these statistics via the power of cutting-edge AI technology.

**Note:**  
If you would like to run WasteLess locally, you must first replace the API keys in lib/main.dart with your own.
